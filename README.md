# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

For this code challenge, you will code a simple React application. The App should display some data
from the SpaceX API (https://docs.spacexdata.com/).
When you are done, make a .zip of your code and send it us by email.
Pre-requisites
There are only two requisites for this challenge: React and Unit testing. But if you want to use any
other technology, keep in mind that we, at FARFETCH, also use Jest, Enzyme, react-testing-library,
GraphQL, Typescript, Redux, CSS modules and Emotion.
The styling part is up to you. Feel free to be creative!
Challenges
1. List all SpaceX launches
The list should have have 2 sections:
o Past launches
o Upcoming launches
By default, the list should display only 4 launches. It should display more items when the user scrolls
down, 4 at a time.
Each list item should display, at least:
o the launch number
o the mission name and year
o the mission success
o the name of the rocket used in the launch
o an image
2. Create list Filters
Create the following list filters:
• Show the launches that took place before or after a date defined the user
• Show the succeeded/unsucceeded launches
• Show the only the past/upcoming launches
It should be possible to combine the filters and so, filtering the list with all of them at the same time.
3. Create favourites
Add the possibility to add a launch to the user favourites.
